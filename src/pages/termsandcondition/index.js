            right to make any modifications and improvements of its choice to
            the Subscriptions, especially related to technical developments. The
            Company undertakes that this does not result in any price increase

            quality or substantial changes in functionality.

            Subscriptions will be notified through the Site at least 1 (one)
            month before it takes effect. The Customer will no longer be liable
            for any payment from the date of Subscription termination and will
            be reimbursed the sums paid for the subscription on a pro-rata basis
            from the effective date of termination.

            offers of varying durations may be offered on the Site, temporarily
            or not. Unless otherwise indicated, these trial or discovery offers
            are subject to these GTC and are limited to a single registration
